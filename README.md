# World-Demographic-Data-Visualization
This is a R programming assignment created as a part of Kirill Eremenko Data Science with R course on Udemy.com. This project involve 
importing csv data of world demographics into R as a data frame, analyze the structure of the data, and manipulating the data frame to 
suit our needs. Lastly, we use qplot to create a scatter plot visualization to better understand the relationship between life expectancy and 
fertility rate of two different time periods.

Attached to this repository is the csv data file, the R code itself, and the two graphs that the code creates.
